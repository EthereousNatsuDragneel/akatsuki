The file dijkstraData.txt contains the graph data, each row indicating a vertex label, and each tuple pair refers to a labeled vertex and the edge length between the row and the vertex. For example, the first row beginning with 1 is the row that refers to the vertex labeled 1. The tuple pair 80,982 means that there is an edge between 1 and 80 and has an edge length of 982. The graph is undirected. Our task is to code up dijkstra's algorithm and run it on this data and report the distances of verticex 7,37,59,82,99,115,133,165,188,197 from vertex 1 (1 is the source).
